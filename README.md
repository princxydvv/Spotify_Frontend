ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone - Frontend UI
A simple frontend clone of Spotify built using HTML and CSS. 
This project replicates the look and feel of Spotifyâ€™s web interface, including the sidebar, main content area, and bottom music player. 
No JavaScript or backendâ€”purely a UI-focused project for learning and practicing responsive web design. I will try to improvise the UI further on in Future and also learn to inegrate the backend for the project.
